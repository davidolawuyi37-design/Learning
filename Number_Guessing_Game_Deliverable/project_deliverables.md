# Project Deliverables: Number Guessing Game

## Project Overview
David will build a simple number guessing game using Python.  
The program will randomly select a number, and the user will try to guess the correct number.

This project helps reinforce:
- Variables
- User input
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Basic program logic

---

## Core Features
The number guessing game should:
1. Generate a random number within a specified range
2. Allow the user to guess the number
3. Tell the user whether their guess is too high or too low
4. Continue until the correct number is guessed
5. Display a success message when the user wins

---

## Functional Requirements
- The program must use a loop to allow repeated guesses
- The user must be able to enter guesses using the keyboard
- The program must compare the user’s guess with the generated number
- Clear messages must guide the user after each guess

---

## Program Flow
1. Generate a random number
2. Ask the user to guess the number
3. Check the guess:
   - If too high, display a message
   - If too low, display a message
   - If correct, display a success message
4. Repeat steps 2–3 until the number is guessed

---

## Deliverables
David must submit:
1. A Python file named `number_guessing_game.py`
2. A working number guessing game
3. Clean and readable code
4. Meaningful output messages
5. Proper use of variables, conditionals, and loops

---

## Success Criteria
The project is considered complete if:
- The program runs without errors
- The user can guess multiple times
- Feedback is given for each guess
- The game ends only when the correct number is guessed
