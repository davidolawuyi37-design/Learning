# Mini Project: Build a Simple Calculator

## Project Overview
David will build a simple calculator program using Python.  
The calculator will allow a user to perform basic arithmetic operations by selecting options from a menu.

This project helps reinforce:
- Variables
- User input
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Clean program structure

---

## Project Requirements

### 1. Program Features
The calculator should be able to:
1. Add two numbers
2. Subtract two numbers
3. Multiply two numbers
4. Divide two numbers
5. Exit the program

---

### 2. Functional Requirements
- Each arithmetic operation must be written as a **separate function**
- The program must display a **menu** to the user
- The user must select an option from the menu
- The program must ask the user to enter two numbers
- The correct function must be called based on the user’s selection

---

### 3. Program Flow
1. Display the calculator menu
2. Ask the user to choose an operation
3. Ask the user to enter two numbers
4. Perform the selected calculation
5. Display the result
6. Repeat the process until the user chooses to exit

---

## Deliverables
David must submit:
1. A Python file named `calculator.py`
2. A working menu-driven calculator program
3. Four clearly defined functions:
   - `add`
   - `subtract`
   - `multiply`
   - `divide`
4. Clean, readable, and well-structured code
5. Clear and meaningful output messages

---

## Sample Menu Layout
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Exit

## Success Criteria
The project is considered complete if:
- The program runs without errors
- All operations work correctly
- The program continues running until the user selects Exit
- Functions are used correctly and appropriately
